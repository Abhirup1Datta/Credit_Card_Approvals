## Predicting_Credit_Card_Approvals
### Methodology:
Used Pandas to load the dataset and get a peek at the underlying data in the dataframe. Cleaned the data, handled missing values and dealt with extreme outliers using suitable methods. Utilised matplotlib and seaborn libraries for detailed visualisation.  
Imported the cleaned data into MySQL and wrote several queries for answering business problems.  
Using scikit-learn library in Python performed data preprocessing and applied various machine learning models to train the data and predict whether the application will be approved or rejected. Analysed and compared the performance of each model using suitable metrics and plot.
