## Predicting_Credit_Card_Approvals  
The project aims to perform a detailed analysis of customer data from credit card applications and build a machine-learning model that can predict whether to issue a credit card to the applicant.
### Methodology:
Used Pandas to load the dataset and get a peek at the underlying data in the dataframe. Performed data pre-processing and exploration using Python, handled missing values and dealt with extreme outliers using relevant methods. Utilised matplotlib and seaborn libraries for detailed visualisation.  
Imported the cleaned data into MySQL and wrote several queries to gain insights on the data. 
Using scikit-learn library in Python performed data scaling and applied various machine learning models to train the data and predict whether the application will be approved or rejected. Analysed and compared the performance of each model using suitable metrics and plot.
